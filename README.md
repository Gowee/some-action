# Sync Contrib Calendar Action
A :octocat:ðŸ”€ GitHub action that helps grabs activities from GitLab, LeetCode, etc., to populate the contribution calendar graph on GitHub. 

## What the action actually does?
For every contribution/activity on other platforms, it accordingly creates an emtpy commit at that time point to light (or deepen the color of) a little square on the contribution graph.

## Setup
Create a new empty repository and activate the action by applying the following <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> workflow (e.g. into `.github/workflows/sync-gitlab.yml`). After that, manually trigger the workflow in the Action tab. 

```yml
on: 
  workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - uses: gowee/sync-contrib-calendar-action@v0.1-alpha
      with:
        source: gitlab
        username: SOME_USERNAME
```
The above workflow is intentionally simplified. For __a complete workflow__ that runs on schedule automatically, refers to [examples](https://github.com/Gowee/sync-contrib-calendar-action/tree/main/examples).


## Notes
### Security
The action has access to the the [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) provided automatically by the GitHub Action runtime, so that to push commits without requiring manual configuration.
Outgoing requests are made only to fetch actitivies from data sources such as GitLab.
But be reminded that the software is provided as-is, with NO WARRANTY. 

### Caveat
The action is not well tested, which, in the worst cases, may result in tons of repeated commits unexpectedly.
It is strongly recommended to create a new repository for the action to work separately.
